🎯 TASK: Enhance the BuildReady™ tool to provide tailored compliance strategies based on the selected Australian state or territory.

---

✅ FEATURE: Dual-Path Compliance Planning
For each build plan, generate **two strategies** depending on user’s state selection:

1. **Import-Ready Plan (Pre-Reg Compliance)**
   - Only include mods that can pass initial registration inspections for that state
   - Highlight high-risk mods that should be avoided pre-reg (e.g., turbo/supercharger, coilovers, engine swaps)
   - Display specific inspection site name (e.g., Regency Park for SA)

2. **Post-Reg Build Plan (Mod After Registration)**
   - Show recommended path for registering vehicle first, then applying mods
   - Include required certifications (e.g., VSCCS for NSW, Engineer Sign-off for SA)
   - Show common post-reg requirements (e.g., ICV, noise/emissions check)

---

✅ CUSTOMIZE BY STATE:

Each state/territory has its own compliance strictness and logic:

- **South Australia**:
  - High risk
  - Pre-reg inspections at Regency Park
  - Recommend keeping vehicles near stock
  - Engineer sign-off often required post-reg for suspension, engine, turbo

- **New South Wales**:
  - Medium strictness
  - VSCCS system allows more flexibility post-reg
  - ICV and brake testing more common

- **Victoria**:
  - Medium-high strictness
  - Noise limits and emissions tests key
  - Pre-reg turbo mods are discouraged

- **Queensland**:
  - More lenient
  - Can register some modded cars pre-reg if documentation is strong
  - Mod Plate system works well post-reg

- **Western Australia / NT / TAS / ACT**:
  - Generally more flexible
  - Post-reg mods easier to get through with engineer sign-off

📦 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

- On state selection, update risk and recommendations for each mod
- Visually tag:
   - ✅ "Recommended for Pre-Reg"
   - 🟡 "Post-Reg with Cert"
   - ❌ "High-Risk Pre-Reg"

- Add optional toggle:  
   > “Show Pre-Reg Plan” | “Show Post-Reg Plan”

- Include state-specific compliance authority in summary (e.g., “Authority: DPTI SA” or “System: VSCCS NSW”)

🔎 PURPOSE:

This creates highly tailored compliance planning guidance based on user location and intended mod sequence. It positions ImportIQ as the most context-aware and trusted import planning platform in Australia.

Bonus: Use this logic to suggest *ideal states to register in* based on mods (e.g., “Want coilovers and a turbo? Register in QLD or NSW first.”)
