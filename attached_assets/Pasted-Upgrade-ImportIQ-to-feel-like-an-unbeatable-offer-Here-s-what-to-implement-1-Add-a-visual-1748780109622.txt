Upgrade ImportIQ to feel like an unbeatable offer. Here's what to implement:

---

1. ✅ Add a visual offer stack card on the signup page:
Title: “✅ What You Get With ImportIQ”
List the following items with emojis and value framing:
- Real-time Cost Calculator ($500+ value per quote)
- Compliance Clarity Guide ($1,500 mistake preventer)
- Mod Planner + Timeline ($800 in time/stress saved)
- AI Import Assistant (24/7 $0 consultation cost)
- Expert Scenarios & Vehicle Picks (avoid $3,000 regrets)
- Free Trial – Full Access (no card, instant start)

Add a "Total Value: $5,000+" line with “Your Price: $97/mo” below it.

---

2. ✅ Add “Proof Mode” logic into tools:
After each result (e.g. cost calc, compliance plan), show a value-based message like:
- “You just avoided $1,250 in potential compliance risk”
- “Your projected ownership cost is 27% below average”

Use simple logic from imported benchmarks or fixed scenarios.

---

3. ✅ On signup page, below trial CTA, add this copy:
"If ImportIQ doesn’t save you money, time, or stress on your next import — you shouldn’t pay for it. That’s why we offer full access for 14 days, no credit card required. You decide if it’s worth it."

---

4. ✅ Add urgency bar under “Start Free Trial Now” CTA:
Style it lightly with red/orange alert style.
Message: 
“⚠️ Import costs are up 40% this quarter. Avoid delays. Lock in your $97/month before we raise prices.”

---

5. ✅ Testimonials logic (placeholder for now):
Add a rotating or fixed section that says:
- “I saved $4,000 avoiding a compliance trap thanks to ImportIQ.”
- “I used to dread importing. Now I know exactly what to expect.”

Allow admin to edit testimonials easily or hardcode 3 for now.

---

Use the clean layout and color fixes previously shared. Maintain responsive stacking and trial logic. Emphasize clarity, confidence, and conversion-focused UX. If you track quote submissions or tool usage during the free trial → you can email users personalized savings summaries like:

“Based on your quote, you avoided $2,045 in compliance risk. ImportIQ is already working for you — let’s lock it in.”
