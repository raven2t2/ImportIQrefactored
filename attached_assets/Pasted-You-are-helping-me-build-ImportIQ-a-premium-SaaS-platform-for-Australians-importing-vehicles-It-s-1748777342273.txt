You are helping me build ImportIQ — a premium SaaS platform for Australians importing vehicles. It’s already live with:

✓ Email-gated access
✓ 14-day free trial logic (no credit card)
✓ Database for trial/user status
✓ Core tools:
  - Import Cost Calculator
  - AI-Powered Service Tier Recommender
  - Compliance Estimator
  - Modification Planner
✓ Pricing: $97/month after trial

Now I want to evolve ImportIQ into an industry-dominating product that delivers **massive value**. Your job is to add and wire up the following feature modules inside the portal. Use minimal, clean UI for now. Function over form.

---

## ✅ New Modules to Build:

### 1. **True Cost Explorer**
An enhanced ownership calculator beyond import costs.
Includes fields for:
- Annual rego fees (based on state dropdown)
- Average insurance estimate (basic/standard/premium tiers)
- Fuel type + estimated yearly consumption cost
- Resale value slider (based on # of years held)

✅ Output: Summary with total 3–5 year ownership cost.

---

### 2. **Build & Comply**
A modification planning tool + compliance checker.
Steps:
- User selects vehicle and state (NSW, VIC, SA, etc.)
- Choose from mod options (wheels, turbo, suspension, etc.)
- Each mod shows green/yellow/red based on compliance risk
- Display compliance path (e.g., engineer cert required)

✅ Output: Custom mod plan + checklist for legal compliance.

---

### 3. **Import Timeline Simulator**
Simulates estimated delivery & registration time based on:
- Shipping origin (Japan/USA)
- Method (RoRo, container)
- User-selected port of entry
- Time of year (for backlog estimate)

✅ Output: Gantt-style visual timeline of steps to road-ready status.

---

### 4. **AI Import Assistant**
Always-available chatbot embedded in the portal.
Handles questions like:
- “Is my car eligible for import?”
- “What do I need for SA rego?”
- “Can I lower this vehicle legally?”

Use GPT-4o API for fast, helpful replies. Context-aware of user’s selected vehicle if available.

✅ Output: Embedded chat bubble or modal. Logged chat optional.

---

### 5. **Expert Picks / Starter Scenarios**
Create a page with pre-filled examples:
- “Import an R34 Skyline” → show total cost + timeline
- “Get a Hellcat into QLD” → steps, risks, and suggestions
- “Budget import under $25K” → show best value path

✅ Output: Click → populate calculator and timeline with editable fields.

---

### 6. **Dashboard Revamp**
Revise dashboard homepage to show:
- Welcome message with trial days remaining
- Quick launch buttons for each tool
- “Recommended for You” AI tip
- CTA to subscribe if trial is near expiry

✅ Output: Clean React-style dashboard layout (minimal CSS, modular design).

---

### 7. **Optional: Power Tools Tier (Future)**
Build structure for power users who pay more:
- Market alerts on specific cars
- Auction price trend graphs
- VIN decoder for build info
- Vehicle watchlist (email alert on drops)

✅ Output: Do not build this yet, just stub it in the codebase.

## 🧠 Brand Language
- Premium, confident tone
- Use phrases like: “road-ready,” “compliance clarity,” “real ownership cost”
- Everything must feel like it’s designed for **high-trust car buyers**

---

## 🔐 Constraints
- All features remain inside the ImportIQ portal
- Maintain 14-day trial logic
- Store user actions and trial status in your database (can be JSON for now)
- No styling polish needed yet – just keep it clean and mobile-friendly
