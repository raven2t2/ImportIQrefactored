🎯 TASK: Add short, descriptive taglines beneath each tool name on the email gate feature list and dashboard module cards to improve clarity and perceived value.

📍 Location:
- client/src/components/email-gate.tsx
- client/src/components/dashboard/ToolCard.tsx (or equivalent component for tool list tiles)

🧠 Purpose:
These taglines are meant to explain what each tool does in plain English — especially for older or less tech-native users. They should display beneath the tool name in a smaller font (e.g., `text-sm` or `text-xs`, muted color like `text-gray-500`).

🧩 Taglines to Implement:

1. **Import Cost Calculator**  
   _"Know your landed cost before you commit."_

2. **True Cost Explorer**  
   _"The total cost of ownership, uncovered."_

3. **BuildReady™**  
   _"Make your dream build road-legal."_

4. **Import Timeline**  
   _"Realistic delivery expectations from port to plate."_

5. **AI Vehicle Recommendations**  
   _"Smarter suggestions based on your goals."_

6. **Expert Picks**  
   _"Pre-screened imports worth a closer look."_

7. **Compliance Estimate**  
   _"Know if your build will pass — and how much it’ll cost."_

8. **Mod Estimator**  
   _"Estimate costs for tuning, mods, and compliance."_

9. **Vehicle Lookup**  
   _"VIN or chassis code? We’ll break it down."_

10. **Registration Stats**  
   _"See what’s already on Aussie roads."_

11. **Import Volume Dashboard**  
   _"What’s entering the country — and from where."_

12. **Auction Sample Explorer**  
   _"Recent comps from Japanese auctions."_

13. **AI Import Assistant**  
   _"Ask anything about your import journey."_

14. **Value Estimator**

💄 Styling Notes:
- Use a soft-muted font color (`text-gray-500` or `text-muted`)
- Small but readable font size (`text-sm` or `text-xs`)
- Consistent vertical spacing between tool title and tagline

🚀 Outcome:
This small enhancement adds clarity, builds trust, and helps users understand the *why* behind each feature, especially important for older users, first-time importers, and dealers unfamiliar with tech products.
