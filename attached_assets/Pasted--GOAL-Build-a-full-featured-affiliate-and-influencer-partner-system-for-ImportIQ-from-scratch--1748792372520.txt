   - Auto-approve or admin-approved toggle
   - Generates unique referral link (e.g., `https://importiq.com?ref=abc123`)

2. **Referral Tracking Logic**
   - Track referrals using cookies or URL params
   - Attribution persists for at least 30 days
   - Show affiliate how many signups and conversions they've driven
   - Store: referral ID, timestamp, user email (if signed up)

3. **Affiliate Dashboard (for Everyone)**
   - Stats: Clicks, Signups, Paid Conversions, Earnings
   - Commission Tier Display (e.g., "Starter – 20% recurring")
   - Current payout balance
   - Button to request payout (manual PayPal or Stripe Transfer)
   - Downloadable share assets (logos, banners)
