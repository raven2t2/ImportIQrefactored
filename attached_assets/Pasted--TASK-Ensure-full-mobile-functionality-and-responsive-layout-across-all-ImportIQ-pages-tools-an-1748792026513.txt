üéØ TASK: Ensure full mobile functionality and responsive layout across all ImportIQ pages, tools, and components.

---

‚úÖ GENERAL LAYOUT:

- All pages must render cleanly on screens 320px‚Äì768px wide (iPhone SE to iPhone 15 Pro Max)
- Use flex or grid with responsive breakpoints for all key sections
- Ensure tool panels, forms, cards, and CTA blocks **stack vertically** on small screens
- Avoid horizontal scrolling unless part of an intentional carousel
- Prevent layout overflow (especially with long labels or result cards)

---

‚úÖ SPECIFIC COMPONENTS TO OPTIMIZE:

1. **Email Gate / Signup Page**
   - Feature grid must stack clearly and remain legible
   - Signup form input fields and CTA button must be easy to tap with thumbs
   - All value content (e.g. ‚Äú$15,000+ of tools‚Äù) should be visible **above the fold**

2. **Dashboard**
   - Tool cards should render in 1-column layout on small screens
   - Ensure padding/margins are consistent for finger-friendly tap zones

3. **Individual Tool Pages (e.g., BuildReady‚Ñ¢, Import Cost Calculator, Auction Explorer)**
   - All tables, output boxes, mod summaries, and risk indicators must scale properly
   - Buttons, inputs, dropdowns should not overlap or go off-screen
   - Ensure dropdowns and toggles are fully accessible via touch (min height 44px)

4. **Modals and Chat Interfaces (e.g., AI Assistant)**
   - Must be fully scrollable inside viewport on mobile
   - Avoid fixed-height issues that cut off content
   - Provide clear close/back navigation

---

‚úÖ TOUCH UX & FONT SCALING:

- Use `rem` or `em` units for text and spacing so font sizes adjust naturally
- Maintain line height for readability on small screens
- Ensure all interactive elements have **minimum touch targets (44x44px)**
- Prevent double-tap zoom by disabling `user-scalable=no` only if all text is legible

---

‚úÖ OPTIONAL (FOR BETTER PWA-LIKE FEEL):
- Add ‚ÄúAdd to Home Screen‚Äù metadata if not already done
- Ensure favicon and splash screen render correctly on iOS and Android

---

üéØ OUTCOME:
ImportIQ should feel like a **true mobile-native app**, not just a downsized web page. All users ‚Äî including on phones ‚Äî should be able to:
- View, scroll, tap, and type easily
- Understand tool outputs without zooming
- Navigate intuitively with no layout bugs or cramped UI
